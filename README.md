# Vaccine-Record--------------------------


The four pictures provided show the process and outcome of the program; the first and second show the process of tracking somebody's vaccines if they had two doses, the third and fourth show the process if they had one dose.

The next link I provided is this same program, but runnable on Replit. 

The zip file is the full program, the py files have the code.
